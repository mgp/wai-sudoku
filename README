Web-based Sudoku game accessible by desktop screen-reader

Description

Sudoku is a fun game, though unfortunately has been difficult to make accessible. The goal of this
project is to build a web-based Sudoku game playable by a person using a desktop screen-reader or
other assistive device. Guidelines exist for building accessible websites, such as the World Wide Web
Consortiumâ€™s (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), and should be adhered to when building the
game.

The key challenge is interface design for the game. How might a person using a screen-reader and
keyboard know the state of the Sudoku board and be able to access it effectively?

Requirements

1. Build accessible Sudoku game.
2. Demonstrate usable with desktop screen-reader.
